# Theme Park Tycoon game

I created this game with two of my friends for a university course. The goal of the course was to learn about project management tools like Git, GitLab, Scrum, Agile and practise working together with others on a project. We used WPF for the UI.

Features:
- You can build Games, Restaurants, Restrooms and connect them with Roads to make them available for visitors
- There are plants you can place down to make the visitors happier, and generators to provide electricity for the different facilities
- Visitors will chose a destination based on the mood and hunger, and walk there on the road network
- Facilities have waiting ques, which can affect the mood of people if it is too long
- The player can run campaigns to boost the number of visitors, and earn more revenue
